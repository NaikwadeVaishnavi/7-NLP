<h1>Welcome to 7-NLP repository!</h1>

<h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
This repository contains resources and code related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
Through algorithms and techniques such as machine learning and deep learning, NLP systems analyze text or speech to extract meaning, sentiment, and structure. 
Common applications include sentiment analysis, language translation, named entity recognition, text summarization, question answering, speech recognition, and chatbots. 
NLP has broad applications across industries and continues to evolve with advancements in machine learning and computational power.
